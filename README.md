# Random Daily Drive

Generates and regenerates a playlist containing your daily podcasts from the original Daily Drive and your favorite songs mixed with recommendations from Spotify.  
Why this name? I was tired from having always the same or similiar songs in my Daily Drive while having lots of saved songs. So I wanted to have a better mix.
